based on QuickSander's [1] Cache2RAM script [2]
improvised for data retainment done right on logout/restart/shutdown/schedule

What is this?
-------------
A bunch of scripts to manage a RamDisk on your mac.


Why use a RamDisk?
------------------
To cache the shit you want to fly fast across the fans :D or, have a look at
these XBench results -

    HDD -
    =====
        Sequential	114.94	
        	Uncached Write	116.50	65.92 MB/sec [256K blocks]
        	Uncached Read	140.07	70.40 MB/sec [256K blocks]
    
        Random	33.36	
        	Uncached Write	103.96	33.28 MB/sec [256K blocks]
        	Uncached Read	117.44	21.79 MB/sec [256K blocks]

    RamDisk -
    =========
        Sequential	973.74	
        	Uncached Write	2530.99	1432.04 MB/sec [256K blocks]
        	Uncached Read	2907.41	1461.24 MB/sec [256K blocks]
        Random	3551.18	
        	Uncached Write	4954.97	1586.27 MB/sec [256K blocks]
        	Uncached Read	7848.65	1456.37 MB/sec [256K blocks]
    
    
What do I use it for?
---------------------
Ever since I put those 2 4gig sticks, I've been caching these on RamDisk -
    * eclipse workspace, projects
    * eclipse plugins
    * android sdk platforms, whichever I'm working on
    * Chrome cache and Application Support/Google/Chrome folder
    * Safari Cache
    * Firefox Cache

Just symlink whatever you wish into the RamDisk.


How do I use this?
------------------
Do the following on a terminal -
    cd ~/Applications
    git clone https://ideamonk@github.com/ideamonk/Rambola.git
    cd Rambola
    ./enable.sh
    
This shall push Rambola into your Login/Logout Hooks. Just logout and log back
in to see a RamDisk mounted in Finder.


How do I disable this?
----------------------
Say you have Rambola in ~/Applications/Rambola, do this on a terminal -

    ~/Applications/Rambola/disable.sh


How do I retain RamDisk data?
-----------------------------
By default Rambola keeps a synced backup into ~/Library/CachesSnapshotRamDisk.
It syncs the RamDisk every time you logout/restart/shutdown and restores when
you start your machine back. If worried about power-cuts, then by default,
Rambola also syncs the backup every 45 minutes in background.


How do I disable the 45 minute syncs running in background?
-----------------------------------------------------------
Get into Rambola's folder, open helper.sh under src and change -
    TIMELY_BACKUP=yes , into,
        
    TIMELY_BACKUP=no


How do I change the time period for automatic background syncs?
---------------------------------------------------------------
Get into Rambola's folder, open helper.sh under src and change the number
in this line -
let SAFETY_BACKUP_INTERVAL=45 # backup interval in minutes


Does it support multiple users?
-------------------------------
Once enabled, it should work for every user. Though I haven't tested it out.


Why was this created?
---------------------
Uh, I assumed QuickSander's sweet app Cache2RAM [2] to be too sweet to retain
things on logout/restart/shutdown. Alas! I lost a bunch of good things I cached
and had to modify to bend it to my own needs.


Why is it named Rambola?
------------------------
Uh, I dunno, maybe 'cause ramona bambola is a bit too hot on tv.

Have fun.
